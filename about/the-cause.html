        <h3>Why Haiti?</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Haiti is the poorest country in the world</li>
            <li>Over 400,000 children in Haiti are without parents.</li>
            <li>1 out of 5 children will die before the age of five.</li>
            <li>Haiti ranks as one of the worst three countries in the world in daily caloric intake.</li>
            <li>Most Haitians do not have access to clean drinking water causing rampant Cholera outbreaks and other waterborne illnesses.</li>
            <li>80% of Haiti’s people live in abject poverty</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What's the plan?</h3>
        <p>Sport's Disciple has already built an incredble soccer program incorporating sports, community service, leadership development, and life classes, all while providing food, clean water, and a safe environment for 1,000 kids. The goal is to expand the program into more cities and villages. Each day, you can hear the sound of children knocking at the gate. They want to join but there's simply not enough space or resources... Let's make sure no kid gets turned away.</p>
